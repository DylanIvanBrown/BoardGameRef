# Board Game Rules Bot

This project is designed to create a bot that can answer questions about

## Goals of Project
- Answer user questions about board game rules

## What You Need to Know to Use This Project
You will need to provide your own keys/values for the following .env variables:
- OPEN_API_KEY
- DB_PASSWORD
- DISCORD_KEY
- DB_HOST
- DB_USER
- DB_NAME

## Development Decisions
- Currently, we are hosting on SparkedHost, but I'm open to changing this when needed for scale etc.

## Feature Ideas
- Once available, use OpenAI plugins tool to feed live data on BGG rankings, etc., from an API caller.
- Bot game scoring from images once we have a model that can do that.
- Custom open-source models that are trained on game rule books that are outside of the data set of Chat GPT-4.
- Option to take pictures of game state or cards in a game to answer rules related to that.
- Option to allow a user to upload their own rulebook for a game not in the training set. Store this and include it in future training of any custom model.
- Include X previous user and assistant messages in the OpenAI call to allow users to query related to a previous message rather than just the game.
- Add flow structure to detect some intents like ranking etc that we can get realtime data from BGG for rather than relying entirely on GPT-4
