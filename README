# Goals of Project

# What You Need to Know to Use This Project
You will need to provide your own keys/values for the following .env variables:
- OPEN_API_KEY
- DB_PASSWORD
- DISCORD_KEY
- DB_HOST
- DB_USER
- DB_NAME

# Development Decisions
- Currently, we are hosting on SparkedHost, but I'm open to changing this.

# Feature Ideas
- Once available, use OpenAI plugins tool to feed live data on BGG rankings, etc., from an API caller.
- Bot game scoring from images once we have a model that can do that.
- Custom open-source models that are trained on game rule books that are outside of the data set of Chat GPT-4.
